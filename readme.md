# Track your dose you dosser

Monitor your weekly and daily dosage, example:

- etc
- salt 
- sugar 
- calories
- medicines
- cigarettes

# How to use

- for both methods make seperate files for each thing you want to track
- near the bottom of the file change the `unit` var
- didn't add Params as I want this to be compatible on computers and phones

### Computer

- got clone this repo (for the dossers who can't figure that out...)
- `python track-dose.py`

### Mobile

- copy and past the code into a python app on your phone
- more convenient as most people always have their phone on them
- even the average dosser you see on the street always has a phone

## Notes 
- if you need help then feel free to get gone you dosser
- go and drink buckfast and piss yourself in the street 
- but make sure you track your dose, you filthy dosser
